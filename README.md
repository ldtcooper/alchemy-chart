# README

Alchemy Chart is a data visualization app inspired by Charto. It allows you to upload data in several data formats, make a variety of charts from that data, and then share those charts with other users. You can find Alchemy Chart [here](alchemychart.herokuapp.com).

## Features
  * Upload data in JSON, CSV, or TSV formats.
  * Create line, bar, area, pie, and scatter charts.
  * Save charts and data for later use.
  * Share charts with other users.

## Design
  Alchemy Charts was brought from [wireframes](https://github.com/ldtcooper/alchemy-chart/wiki/Wireframes) to wired up in about two weeks.
  Its backend is built with Ruby on Rails on a PostgreSQL database, while the frontend is React and Redux with visual design inspired by Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/).
