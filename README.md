# README

Alchemy Charts is a data visualization app based off of Charto. It's currently in the very earliest stages of production, so there isn't much to write about at the moment. However, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ldtcooper/alchemy-chart/wiki) or the [milestones](https://github.com/ldtcooper/alchemy-chart/milestones) to see where it is going.
And don't just forget this readme -- it'll evolve as the project does.
